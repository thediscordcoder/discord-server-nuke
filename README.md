# discord-server-nuke
destroyer of discord servers

First, download the .py file, make sure you have the modules installed.


Replace the INSERT TOKEN HERE with your bot token, which can be obtained in the developer api.

(you need to create a bot in the api first)


in the Oauth2 bar, scroll down to the checkbox and click bot. Another new checkbox should appear below.

Scroll down again. Click administrator in this checkbox.

Then, go back to the top checkbox and copy the link.

You can paste the link into your browser to invite the bot to a discord server that you have bot invite privileges on.

If you don't have invite privileges, you can still give the link to a server owner/admin and tell them "it is a moderation bot" or something

If the server owner/admin is dumb enough, they will add the bot to the server


When you are ready, type this into the command line: (replace filename with the files name)

python3 filename.py

The bot will begin running and any message in the discord server will start the bot spam pinging.


It is most effective when you type messages into every channel possible to get the bot spamming everyone in more than one channel
